# Hello World of Game Development 🎮

This is my **first ever game project**, created by following the [Brackeys tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys).
It’s a simple but fun game that introduced me to the **basics of game development**, including Unity, C#, and game design principles.

The game is a beginner-friendly project demonstrating:

- Player movement
- Collision detection
- Score system
- Restart functionality

It’s not meant to be a polished, full game — rather, it is my **first step into the world of making games**.
